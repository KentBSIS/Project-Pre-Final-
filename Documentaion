Documentation and Explanation of Visual Novel - Dispatch Decision Engine in C++
By: Aljosh Kyle Benedict A. Mendoza / Kent Steven N. Abillon


Project Goal

Design and create the functional structure for a simple, text-based visual novel (VN) featuring the character Robert from Dispatch. The program must incorporate at least five distinct decision points, where user input (a choice) determines the flow of the story and updates character relationship variables using C++ functions and Boolean logic.


Variable and its Explanation:

bool isMerciful 
//This variable tracks Robert's moral decision path.

bool isRomanticTension 
//This variable used to track the romantic tension of Robert and Blonde Blazer.

bool isRobertInjured 
//This variable is responsible for identifying if Robert is injured in a fight scene.

int Blonde_BlazerInterest 
//This variable estimates the Blonde Blazer impression where when it is high, she is more expressive.

int Flambae_Anger_Level 
//Estimate the anger level of Flambae in the bar scene. It increases when Robert throws water on him but it increase more when it Robert throws the Alcohol


Functions:

void typewrite(string text, int speed = 50000) 
//Prints the text with pacing like a typewriter effect to make the game more expressive.

main()
//Function everything in the code/program. 

void scene_apartment_interrogation() 
//Introduce the play to the main character which is Robert and shows the conflict of the story which is the history of his father and the pursuit of Shroud.
// The bool isMerciful is triggered in this scene, the player can decide to be less violent sparing the enemy or show pity, when this path is chosen the bool isMerciful became true but, if the player decide to be more violent then the player takes the brutal path for the enemy then the bool isMerciful became false.
